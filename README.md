# breeze
A personal coding project I started back in summer of 2023.


the concept ~~was~~ __is__ to convert images into pixelated grid-like patterns to follow along with while crocheting.

~~it is no longer being continued~~
## Breeze has re-entered development as of May 2024, this time as a web app!
